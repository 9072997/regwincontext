I've spent the better part of a day trying to figure out how to register
context-menu items for a particular extension in Windows 10. This is my
solution. It requires admin rights to run.

usage: regwincontext.exe pdf 'Menu Entry' 'C:\Path\to\myapp.exe'

If you need to build this for x86, be sure to change build.bat
